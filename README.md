# GTK3 Espionage

__WARNING: Using this library is a bad idea__

__Current status:__ `not yet functional`

gtk3-espionage is a header-only library for extracting and modifying internal GTK state. The headers are automatically constructed from multiple versions of GTK3. This lets programs be compatible with all supported GTk versions, despite using internals that are not part of the stable API. Note that using gtk3-espionage is generally harder than forking GTK and adding the features you want, however it may be useful if you don't wish to maintain and distribute an entire GTK.

## Using in your project

TODO

## Building

__NOTE:__ you don't need to build in order to use this project. Building the header files is only required when GTK has been updated or a structure is added

Requirements:
- Linux
  - MacOS *might* just work, but is untested
  - Porting to Windows probably requires a small effort
- Python3
- Git

To build, run `./scripts/build.py`

This script will
- Load the list of structures from [scripts/config.py](scripts/config.py)
- Clone the official GTK git repository
- Detect all supported versions of GTK
- Check out and extract data from each version
- Write header files for each structure
