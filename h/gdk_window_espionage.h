  /* The paint logic here is a bit complex because of our intermingling of
   * cairo and GL. Let's first go over the cairo-alone case:
   *
   *  1) gdk_window_begin_paint_region() is called with an update region. If
   *     the backend wants it, we redirect drawing to a temporary surface
   *     sized the same as the update region and set `surface_needs_composite`
   *     to TRUE. Otherwise, we paint directly onto the real server-side window.
   *
   *  2) Things paint with cairo using gdk_cairo_create().
   *
   *  3) When everything is painted, the user calls gdk_window_end_paint().
   *     If there was a temporary surface, this is composited back onto the
   *     real backing surface in the appropriate places.
   *
   * This is similar to double buffering, except we only have partial surfaces
   * of undefined contents, and instead of swapping between two buffers, we
   * create a new temporary buffer every time.
   *
   * When we add GL to the mix, we have this instead:
   *
   *  1) gdk_window_begin_paint_region() is called with an update region like
   *     before. We always redirect cairo drawing to a temporary surface when
   *     GL is enabled.
   *
   *  2) Things paint with cairo using gdk_cairo_create(). Whenever
   *     something paints, it calls gdk_window_mark_paint_from_clip() to mark
   *     which regions it has painted in software. We'll learn what this does
   *     soon.
   *
   *  3) Something paints with GL and uses gdk_cairo_draw_from_gl() to
   *     composite back into the scene. We paint this onto the backing
   *     store for the window *immediately* by using GL, rather than
   *     painting to the temporary surface, and keep track of the area that
   *     we've painted in `flushed_region`.
   *
   *  4) Something paints using software again. It calls
   *     gdk_window_mark_paint_from_clip(), which subtracts the region it
   *     has painted from `flushed_region` and adds the region to
   *     `needs_blended_region`.
   *
   *  5) Something paints using GL again, using gdk_cairo_draw_from_gl().
   *     It paints directly to the backing store, removes the region it
   *     painted from `needs_blended_region`, and adds to `flushed_region`.
   *
   *  6) gdk_window_end_paint() is called. It composites the temporary surface
   *     back to the window, using GL, except it doesn't bother copying
   *     `flushed_region`, and when it paints `needs_blended_region`, it also
   *     turns on GL blending.
   *
   * That means that at any point in time, we have three regions:
   *
   *   * `region` - This is the original invalidated region and is never
   *     touched.
   *
   *   * `flushed_region` - This is the portion of `region` that has GL
   *     contents that have been painted directly to the window, and
   *     doesn't have any cairo drawing painted over it.
   *
   *   * `needs_blended_region` - This is the portion of `region` that
   *     GL contents that have part cairo drawing painted over it.
   *     gdk_window_end_paint() will draw this region using blending.
   *
   * `flushed_region` and `needs_blended_region` never intersect, and the
   * rest of `region` that isn't covered by either is the "opaque region",
   * which is any area of cairo drawing that didn't ever intersect with GL.
   * We can paint these from GL without turning on blending.
